						<h3>My Project and Goals</h3>
						<p>Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Ressa Reneth Sarreal, and this website was designed to describe my experiences regarding research, academics, and extracurricular activities. I am currently, as of September 2019, a second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) PhD student working with Dr. Pamela Bhatti at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My primary research project involves the development and design of electromagnetic cochlear implants. The goal of this project is to show if electromagnetic fields are capable of improving cochlear implant performance. Optimization software, COMSOL simulation software, and coil fabrication and testing were utilized thus far. Future work includes neuronal stimulation, electrode array design, and en vivo testing to demonstrate electromagnetic capabilities in a neuronal environment.Â </p>
