						<h3>My Project and Goals</h3>
						<p>My mentor, Professor Gabriela Marcu, assigned me to work on creating a managable interface and system that will be used for research purposes. The system will be made specifically for the Caldwell Psychology Lab, and they plan on using it to gather data on people whose learning may be affected by their age, disabilities or other factors. In addition to this project, I have also been assigned to a project given to the Empathic Design and Technology lab by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The project entails creating an app targeted towards HIV-positive youth that will improve their medication adherence while remaining sensitive to their condition of health. 

 						My goals within this ten-week program were to complete my initial 						assignment of creating the Caldwell Concept Formation Lab interface 						system and contributing to the app.

						I entered this program with hopes that this it will help me develop skills that involve independence and collaboration. I had to learn new concepts that are pulled from computer science and psychology to advance in my project, while being able to keep pace with other interns that I am working with to complete these tasks within certain deadlines. 

						This experience definitely helped me develop a large area of skill sets to help me become a better researcher.</p>
