						<h3>My Project and Goals</h3>
						<p>Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Ressa Reneth Sarreal, and this website was designed to describe my experiences regarding research, academics, and extracurricular activities. I am currently, as of August 2022, a fifth-year Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) PhD student working with Dr. Pamela Bhatti at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My primary research project involves the development and design of a micromagnetic alternative to cochlear implant electrode arrays. The goal of this project is to evaluate if electromagnetic fields generated by implantable microcoil structures are capable of improving cochlear implant performance by reducing spread of excitation. Finite-element modeling, microcoil fabrication, and radiation testing methods were utilized thus far. Future work includes in vitro and  in vivo testing to validate the microcoil array electromagnetic stimulation capabilities in a neuronal environment.Â </p>

								<h3>About Me</h3>
								<p>My name is Ressa Reneth Sarreal. I am a fifth-year ECE PhD student  at Georgia Tech. In May 2018 I graduated, summa cum laude, at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. I am a Meyerhoff Scholar (M26) as well as a MARC U*STAR scholar. In May 2020 I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech.
								<br>
								I am working towards a career in R&D as well as management in the field of hardware system design and development. In later years, I am interested in a career in academia and advising. My projected graduation date is in December 2022.
