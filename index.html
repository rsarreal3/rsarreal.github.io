						<h3>My Project and Goals</h3>
						<p>Hello! Welcome to my website. My name is Ressa Reneth Sarreal, and this website was designed to describe my experiences regarding research, academics, and extracurricular activities. I am currently, as of September 2019, a second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) PhD student working with Dr. Pamela Bhatti at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My primary research project involves the development and design of electromagnetic cochlear implants. The goal of this project is to show if electromagnetic fields are capable of improving cochlear implant performance. Optimization software, COMSOL simulation software, and coil fabrication and testing were utilized thus far. Future work includes neuronal stimulation, electrode array design, and en vivo testing to demonstrate electromagnetic capabilities in a neuronal environment.Â </p>

								<h3>About Me</h3>
								<p>My name is Ressa Reneth Sarreal. I am a second-year ECE PhD student  at the Georgia Institute of Technology, also known as Georgia Tech. In May 2018 I graduated, summa cum laude, at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.
								<br>
								I am working towards a career in research team management in the field of biomedical devices development. Specifically, I am inclined to work towards improving the quality of life of the elderly. In later years, I am interested in a career in academia and advising.
